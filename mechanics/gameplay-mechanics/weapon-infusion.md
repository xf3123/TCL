# Weapon Infusion

Infusion is a mechanic that converts a character's attacks to a specific element. This affects all Normal Attacks, Charged Attacks, and Plunge Attacks. Infusions can be overridden unless explicitly stated otherwise.

Infusions apply a 1WU (Weapon gauge Unit) every refresh timing if overrideable\[[1](../../evidence/mechanics/gameplay-mechanics/weapon-infusion.md#weapon-gauges)\]. This follows standard reaction principles.
