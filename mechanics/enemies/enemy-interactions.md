# Enemy Interactions

## Bosses

Triggering a freeze reaction on a boss entity does not create a frozen aura on the entity, but rather consumes the hydro and cryo auras, leaving no aura behind.

## Ruin Guards

* Polearm charge attacks, with the exception of Xiao, don't register on stunned Ruin Guards because of the "leaping forward" animation that occurs.
  * [Hu Tao vs Ruin Guard](https://youtu.be/5y6GCZar_2g)
  * Tartaglia's melee charged attack also has the same issue, however it's because their charged attack pushes them back, making them unable to reach the hitbox.
* Ruin Guards can jump over Geo Traveller's Wake of Earth walls, but cannot jump over Geo MC's Starfell Sword meteorites.
  * While Wake of Earth's walls cannot block the Ruin Guard, they can sometimes interfere with its jump, making it land farther away from the player than it normally would.
