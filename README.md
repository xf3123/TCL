# Theorycrafting Library

The KeqingMains subreddit and Discord staff are undermanned and stretched thin across the 10+ communities that are partnered with us. Unfortunately, we did not have many alternatives that could succinctly display the volume of information on our Google Doc until now!

{% hint style="danger" %}
The new format of the TCL is under heavy construction as we work to move over 180+ pages and over 5 months worth of work.

## Newsletter

The newsletter is a way for you to catchup on the latest submissions to the Theorycrafting Library \(TCL\) quickly without needing to hop between servers and channels to see them. They will be updated every 3 weeks and archived in a section underneath.
