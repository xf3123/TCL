### Burst Mechanics

* Q does not snapshot.
  * [Greyhound\#7836](https://youtu.be/ZjMlW6LugdI): Notice how the 4pc pale flame buff that expires midway does not effect the end damage.
  * ColaSenami\#6861
    * [Control Test](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RoQ6NOXlmY4)
    * [Eula Q cast inside Bennett Burst and then allowed the buffs to expire on Eula](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PVpcn5ZqIU)
  * When the lightsword from Q lights up and is about to explode, it's still updating live stats. - [Greyhound\#7836](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JY83ExfS8c)
* 2 Noblesse Oblige affects the Lightfall Sword damage of Glacial Illumination - denmax\#9293
  * [With NO](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb-Wx-RoUww)  
  * [Without NO](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvT1xzI_nDI)
* Eula's Q CD and energy resets at the Burst's hitmark.
  * [Artesians\#0002](https://clips.twitch.tv/SmoggyConcernedBibimbapTBTacoRight-c88YbIbyjUHozu7a)
  * [Zeitraffer\#1074](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/843239715515269160/844511791622127616/Eula_Ult_Timings.mp4)
* The duration of Glacial Illumination is not effected by hitlag. - [Artesians\#0002](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/798969666881323018/844275942045515830/lightfallsword.mp4)
* Eulaâ€™s Lightfall sword damage can be blocked by [wooden](https://imgur.com/a/bL0UttC) and [geo](https://imgur.com/a/PU9gkvv) mitachurl shields. - Jalapeno\#0004
* Glacial Illumination and Lightfall Sword Range - [Greyhound\#7836](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMUqkC1ruGs) \(1 abyss tile is around 2.55m\)
  * Glacial Illumination cast is ~8m 
  * Lightfall Sword explosion is ~7m

### Lightfall Stack Mechanics

* Lightfall stacks are independent of enemies hit, meaning hitting multiple enemies will not net more stacks compared to hitting one enemy. - [Faranight\#0001](https://youtu.be/PbZMPM23hk8)
* The initial hit of Eula's Q does not grant a lightfall stack. - ColaSenami\#6861
  * [Eula Q in front of Geovishap](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RoQ6NOXlmY4) - hit initial dmg & force lightfall burst early
  * [Eula Q away from Geovishap](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ug5RHliBnBg) - initial dmg not hitting the geovishap & force lightfall burst early
* Charged attacks don't grant lightfall stacks. - [Some Missionary\#8340](https://youtu.be/r3PActt3bqc)
* Confirmation that lightfall stacks cannot be gained when hitting [abyss mage](https://youtu.be/RwXRC9ayx9I), [wooden](https://youtu.be/xyfB2P00tUA), and [geo](https://youtu.be/4gbZ9v2OlCQ) shields, because stacks are only gained on damage. - nat\#4502 
* Lightfall stacks are not gained when the Lightfall Sword lights up and is about to explode. - Eko\#6090
  * [Base Damage Check](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/844317292208848937/845032011386060820/Genshin_Impact_2021.05.20_-_15.56.24.02.DVR.mp4)
  * [Hits during the animation](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/844317292208848937/845032486214959164/Genshin_Impact_2021.05.20_-_15.59.20.05.DVR.mp4)
  * [Hits right before](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/844317292208848937/845032641145339964/Genshin_Impact_2021.05.20_-_15.58.21.04.DVR.mp4)
* NA multihits, Hold E Icewhirls, and A1 sword remnant all individually add 1 Glacial Illumination stack. Every damage instance adds one Lightfall stack. This means that Eula's third normal attack, which hits twice, will add two stacks, as will her fifth. Eula's held elemental skill, when it triggers base damage, two icewhirls, and an A4 trigger, will add four Lightfall stacks.- [Greyhound\#7836](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaG8WuCSqBE) 
  * [Table of full values](https://gyazo.com/7831cdd292a0c0a3fb9777ae30f15afe), below is summary of the linked image

| Combo | Stacks |
| :--- | :--- |
| N1 | 1 |
| N2 | 2 |
| N3 | 4 |
| N1 x3 | 3 |
| N2 x2 | 4 |
| Hold E \(1 Grimheart\) | 2 |
| Hold E \(2 Grimheart\) | 4 |
| N4 + N1 | 6 |
| N4 + N2 | 7 |
| N5 | 7 |

### Ascension Mechanics

* Eula A1 scales with Q talent level. - [Greyhound\#7836](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jes9lCeSnqE)
* Eula A1 is considered Elemental Burst damage and is buffed by 2NO. - [Greyhound\#7836](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtCOq6VCV4M)

### Constellation Mechanics

#### C1

* Whenever you consume a Grimheart stack, no matter the amount of stacks consumed, Eula's Physical DMG is increased by 30% for a base of 6 seconds + 6 per Grimheart stack. - [Sonickid15\#1738](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFaejhz3Rik)
  * So 1 stack is 12 seconds and 2 is 18 seconds

### Broken Pines Synergy

* Broken Pines attack speed increase between R1-R5 does not increase your stack count with optimal combos. However, it does make your combo timings a lot less strict and comfier. - Artesians\#0002 and Sitri\#9504
  * Test was done with an [Attack speed increase abyss card](eula.md)
  * Also checks out with [math](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/843239715515269160/844498188303335444/unknown.png)
